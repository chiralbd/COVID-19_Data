## Dashboards 
<p align="justify">
The World Health Organization (WHO), researchers from Johns Hopkins University, and other institutions all maintain datasets on the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries from the disease These are made in a number of useful dashboards and websites listed below.

Because these helpful tools already exist, we at Jagannath University Coronavirus Resource Center will not publish yet another dashboard or data tracker. But we have a plan to create a dashboard for tracking the coronavirus cases in Bangladesh and other country/region as well. Instead we list available data sources below and embed the dashboards from Johns Hopkins University, WHO, and HealthMap.
